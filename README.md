# Python Task Manager (To-Do List)
A command-line based productivity tool built to manage tasks with different status states, demonstrating efficient use of Python dictionaries and JSON persistence.

## 🚀 Features
* **Task Tracking:** Add and remove tasks with ease.
* **Status Management:** Mark tasks as `not_done`, `progres`, or `done`.
* **Filtered Lists:** Specifically view tasks based on their current status (In Progress, Done, or Not Done).
* **Persistence:** Export your current task list to an `Application.json` file for future use.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Structure:** Dictionary-based state management.
* **Storage:** JSON (for data persistence)

## 🕹️ How to Use
1. **Run the program:** `python your_filename.py`
2. **Commands:** Use `add`, `remove`, `mark`, or the `list_` commands to manage your tasks.
3. **Save:** Type `save` to export your data to `Application.json`.

## 🎯 Learning Progress
This project allowed me to practice dictionary manipulation and iteration. Filtering data based on specific values (status states) is a fundamental skill in data processing, which I aim to refine during my time at SAP.
